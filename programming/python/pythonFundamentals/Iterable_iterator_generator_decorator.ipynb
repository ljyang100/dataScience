    "### General\n",

    "An iterator is any object that, pointing to some element in a range of elements (such as an array or a container), has the ability to iterate through the elements of that range using a set of operators (**with at least the increment (++) and dereference operators)**. My comments: for languages without pointer, ++ is usually the next() function. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The most obvious form of iterator is a pointer**: A pointer can point to elements in an array, and can iterate through them using the increment operator (++). But other kinds of iterators are possible. For example, each container type (such as a list) has a specific iterator type designed to iterate through its elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that while a pointer is a form of iterator, not all iterators have the same functionality of pointers; Depending on the properties supported by iterators, they are classified into five different categories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Input and output iterators are the most limited types of iterators: they can perform sequential single-pass input or output operations.  Forward iterators have all the functionality of input iterators and -if they are not constant iterators- also the functionality of output iterators, although they are limited to one direction in which to iterate through a range (forward). **All standard containers support at least forward iterator types.** Bidirectional iterators are like forward iterators but can also be iterated through backwards. Random-access iterators implement all the functionality of bidirectional iterators, and also have the ability to access ranges non-sequentially: distant elements can be accessed directly by applying an offset value to an iterator without iterating through all the elements in between. These iterators have a similar functionality to standard pointers (pointers are iterators of this category). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterator is an object\n",
    "Pointer is also a type. So it can be taken as a class object, but a simple object. Just like int is also a type, or a class instance. Pointer is the simple iterator.  Other iterator (class object) can be very complicated. For example, `std::vector<int>::iterator`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on what types, a pointer can be random-access iterator (e.g. iterator for vector, deque, array), bidirectional iterator(e.g. linked list, set, map), or forward iterator (e.g. forward list).... So an pointer is not a fix-type iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterator (including the Python generator) is an object, and thus it is not like a function. Function normally stored in stack and will be destroyed when returned. An object is stored in heap, and will be destroyed when required. So it can keep state and resume from previous state. In python, function is also an object, where is it stored?   \n",
    "\n",
    "Smart pointer, although can be implemented with the minimum requirements of iterator object, I think we cannot use it as an iterator. For example, the shared_ptr is used as a reference-counter pointer. If we ++ or -- the pointer externally, then it will have big problem. \n",

    "* Forward iterator: forward_list`<int>` for example. Unordered containers provide at least forward iterators. Sometimes also provide bidirectional iterators.\n",
    "* input iterator: read and process value while iterating forward; `*iter`. Of course we can ++iter because this is the minimum requirement of iterator. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Defintions\n",
    "* The iterable needs either a method '__iter__', which returns an iterator, or a '__getitem__' method with sequential indexes starting with 0. So we can check whether __iter__ method exists to see whether an object is an iterable, right? I think the reason to have a __iter__ in an iterable is that this iterable object can return an iterator by calling object.__iter__(), or iter(object). Both ways will return an iterator object, i.e., it will produce an extra __next__ method. \n",
    "* In Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol. That is: the iterator protocol consists of two methods. The __iter__() method, which must return the iterator object, and the __next__ method, which returns the next element from a sequence.  NOTE: later I  have an example, that I can use next() on an object which has not __iter__ but only have __next__ defined.\n",
    "* From the two definitions above (for python, C++ is bit different), iterator has an extra method __next()__ defined. So an iterator must be an iterable, but an iterable is not necessarily an iterator. For example, a list is an iterable but not an iterator. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "* Iterator is an object that KEEPS STATE and produces the next value when you call __next__() on it. The syntax is a = iterator_object.__iter__(), then a is just the iterator_object, b= iterator_object.__next__() will return next value. Note here, keeping state is not the special thing of generator. It is the property of iterator and generator is just an iterator.\n",
    "*  Note  these two methods are different from the python built-in funcitons iter() and next(). python iter() accept iterable as argument, while __iter__ only works as a method (attibute) of iterator object. In other words, __iter__() does not have an argument. However, iter() and __iter__ are also connected, as seen later. \n",
    "* So what is going on behind the scenes, when a for loop is executed? The for statement calls iter() on the object ( which should be a so-called container object), which it is supposed to loop over. If this call is successful, the iter call will return return an iterator object that defines the method __next__() which accesses elements of the object one at a time.  You can call the __next__() method using the next() built-in function. This is how it works:\n"

Finally note that we need to underscore in each side of the methods above. For python_2 there are not underscores. For legacy code, we need change next() within a class (not the build-in next() of python) to __next__().\n",
    "* Often, for pragmatic reasons, iterable classes will implement both __iter__  and __next__ in the same class, and have __iter__ return self, which makes the class both an iterable and its own iterator. It is perfectly fine to return a different object as the iterator, though. How about in C++? It has a separate iterator class? \n",

    "# Generators\n",
    "In this section of the course we will be learning the difference between iteration and generation in Python and how to construct our own Generators with the *yield* statement. Generators allow us to generate as we go along, instead of holding everything in memory.**I need fully understand this point.** \n",
    "\n",
    "We've touched on this topic in the past when discussing certain built-in Python functions like range(), map() and filter().\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore a little deeper. We've learned how to create functions with <code>def</code> and the <code>return</code> statement. Generator functions allow us to write a function that can send back a value and then **later resume to pick up where it left off. How is this implemented in background?**. This type of function is a generator in Python, allowing us to generate a sequence of values over time. The main difference in syntax will be the use of a <code>yield</code> statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most aspects, a generator function will appear very similar to a normal function. The **main difference** is when a generator function is compiled they become an object that supports an **iteration protocol**. That means when they are called in your code they don't actually return a value and then exit. Instead, generator functions will automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the last point of value generation. The main advantage here is that instead of having to compute an entire series of values up front, the generator computes one value and then suspends its activity awaiting the next instruction. This feature is known as **state suspension**.\n",

    "### Difference between generator and iterator\n",
    "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2776829/difference-between-pythons-generators-and-iterators  \n",
    "iterator is a more general concept: any object whose class has a next method (__next__ in Python 3) and an __iter__ method that does return self. (In C++, the minimum requirement for iterator is ++itr, and dereference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every generator is an iterator, but not vice versa. A generator is built by calling a function that has one or more yield expressions (yield statements, in Python 2.5 and earlier), and is an object that meets the previous paragraph's definition of an iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to use a custom iterator, rather than a generator, when you need a class with somewhat complex state-maintaining behavior, or want to expose other methods besides next (and __iter__ and __init__). Most often, a generator (sometimes, for sufficiently simple needs, a generator expression) is sufficient, and it's simpler to code because state maintenance (within reasonable limits) is basically \"done for you\" by the frame getting suspended and resumed. **So basically generator provides a simpler way for you to produce a special iterator that can generate, suspend, and resume.** \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a generator such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "def squares(start, stop):  \n",
    "    for i in range(start, stop):  \n",
    "        yield i * i  \n",
    "\n",
    "generator = squares(a, b)  \n",
    "or the equivalent generator expression (genexp)  \n",
    "\n",
    "generator = (i*i for i in range(a, b)) would take more code to build as a custom iterator:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Squares(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, start, stop):\n",
    "       self.start = start\n",
    "       self.stop = stop\n",
    "    def __iter__(self): return self\n",
    "    def next(self): #In Python 3, it should be def __next__(self):\n",
    "       if self.start >= self.stop:\n",
    "           raise StopIteration\n",
    "       current = self.start * self.start\n",
    "       self.start += 1\n",
    "       return current\n",
    "\n",
    "iterator = Squares(a, b)\n",
